            <p>In this project, I am presenting an immersive experience where people will at first go through the current habit of food and clothing consumption. We will see piles of clothes, and abundance of fast food.</p>
            <p>Then the viewers will go through the effects of such habits. We will see lots of garbage everywhere, which resembles the earth we are going through right now.</p>
            <p>After looking at this future, viewer will take another turn. They can see logo of our organization: <a href="https://www.storyofstuff.org" target="_blank">The Story of Stuff Project</a>. They will then enter the new habits and respective accelerated future.</p>
            <p>Here we will see the habit of slow clothing and slow food, which will increase awareness about responsible consumption and production. The story ends with a view of a sustainable environment.</p>
